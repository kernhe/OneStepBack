[b] OneStepBack README [/b]

OneStepBack is a Gtk 2 and 3 theme with some colors and embossed widgets inspired by the good old NextStep look. I'm old.

It is developed from scratch, is light and minimal, uses only three shades of grays and one color. That was the challenge.

It has been tested on Arch Linux with Gnome-Shell, Gtk+ from 3.16 to 3.22, a good amount of Gtk2 applications and some Gtk3 applications. A lot of widget controls are still missing and it is not tested at all with unity or xfce.

The author is Jean-Pierre Bucciol <jpsspam[at]free.fr>.

This is a GPL 3 free software. Feel free to change and share the code.

This is the version 0.93, released in May 2017.

To install the theme, unzip the archive and copy the theme in your theme directory. (For gtk 3.16 and 3.18 users, the archive contents also a directory called OneStepBack-3.16-18: extract and copy it in your theme directory.)
